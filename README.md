# Cessna 208B Improvement-Mod for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

## About

Started as a simple project to combine two of the most significant mods for the C208B. Taking the engine and flight model from https://github.com/Exp232/C208-MSFS2020-Fix and combining them with the systems and avionics from https://github.com/SheepCreativeSoftware/msfs2020-C208-Improvment-Mod Further building upon their work, with the goal of bringing the stock C208B much closer to reality.

Many thanks to everyone involved.

## Limitations

There are a number of quirks inherent to MSFS that limit the fidelity that can be achieved. Most notable is the incorrect turbine behaviour, lack of beta range, feathering or propeller drag. It's possible some of these can be overcome, others faked, but the results will likely never be truly accurate.

## Required

Working Title's G1000 v0.3.4:
https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages/releases/tag/g1000-v0.3.4

Included in this mod is a small fix for Working Title's G1000 v0.3.4, which enables annunciations. Installing this mod will replace the following file: *workingtitle-g1000\html_ui\WorkingTitle\Pages\VCockpit\Instruments\NavSystems\SharedCommonPFD_MFD.js* so it's important to install in the correct order (see How to install).

If you're using a tool to manage your mods, you may need to replace this file manually.
